How to contribute

Please only contribute if you are a super-newbie coder with experience in html, css and/or javascript.

There are a couple of different ways you can contribute to this project:

1) Take a look at the issues tab and see if there's an issue that you want to resolve. Write a comment asking to be assigned. Once assigned fork the repo, clone it to your machine and make your edits. Then when you're done make your Pull Request back to this repo.

or 

2) Within the experiences folder create your own page to add to the Super-Newbie's guide with tips, tricks and what you've learnt/your experience of Hacktoberfest (think like an article or blog post). You can even create your own CSS stylesheet. 

Name your files Fname-Lname.html and Fname-Lname.css so they are easy for me to keep track of :)

The only prerequisite is that you add a link back to the homepage (index.html) file at the top of your page. Then make your Pull Request. We will then add a link to your page from the homepage so that everyone can read about your experiences.
