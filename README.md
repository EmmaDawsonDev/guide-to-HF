Welcome to the awesome Super-Newbie Coder's Guide to Hacktoberfest!

If this is your first time completing Hacktoberfest and you know the basics of HTML, CSS and maybe a little Javascript then this is the place for you!

Take a look at the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for ways to contribute to the project.

If you need any help please feel free to contact me, I'm most easily reached on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emmalearnscode) @emmalearnscode.

Happy Coding!
