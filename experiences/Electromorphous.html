      <h4>
        Here is a resource that was very useful to me as a beginner to
        open-source
      </h4>

          <a href="https://youtu.be/c6b6B9oN4Vg"
            >Contributing to Open Source for the first time</a
          >
        </h1>
        <p>
          This is a YouTube video and I cannot count the number of times I found
          myself going back to it. It demonstrates all the basic steps to make a
          PR and it was really all I ever needed to make PRs.
        </p>

      <h4>Here are my experiences with open-source</h4>
      <div class="card">
        <h1>
          <a href="https://youtu.be/MT6M_sqAuZo"
            >How to Open Source Like a Pro</a
          >
        </h1>
        <p>
          Above is also a YouTube video and I find myself saying that I cannot
          agree more with Ben. All the points he makes in this video are true
          imo and have convinced me that open-source is really not worth the
          time and energy unless you get to show your work as your own or you're
          new to the tech community and want to learn how to read and modify
          other people's code.

        I contributed to a
        <a href="https://github.com/alik0211/pokedex">Pok√©dex</a> a few days ago
        and the changes I made would make the page look a lot better but the
        owner of the repo didn't think so. I ended up making my changes into
        <a href="https://github.com/Electromorphous/pokedex">my own repo</a> and
        now I will be working to improve it.
      </h6>
      <h6>
        So in a nutshell, I do not approve of working for someone else's code
        unless you are <b>REALLY</b> getting something out of it for yourself.
        Don't do it just because all the cool kids are doing it.
      </h6>
      <h5>
        I know what you are wondering... "Aseer, what did YOU do it for then?"
      </h5>
      <h4>
        Well, I always like a little change and trying out something new...
        never know when you will find an amazing way to grow. And don't you
        forget about that sweet #SWAG.
      </h4>
      <h1 class="stickers">I did it all for the Stickers!! ü§ü</h1>

      <h4>
        Will I be doing it again? Maybe ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø <br />
        I found a new project for my github this time, I'm working on a Pok√©dex
        cuz of this fest. I will surely try open-source again if I think it is
        going to benefit my growth in any way.
