    <h1>My first PR experience</h1>
    <p>So this year I got to know about this Hacktober fest and I decided to participate. However, I had no prior knowledge about how anything really worked. I had no idea of pull requests and even how to run git and github.<br>
    But in the end I got it all after a few tries, just because I decided that I had to do it. So I spent hours searching around Google, watching tutorials on Youtube and trust me if you know where to look you will find all the answers. So believe in yourself and just do it!</p>
