          I'm studying web programming and looking for a job as junior backend
          engineer. i've spend last summer with react.js and express.js. <br />
          in that time, i was buried under several error masseges and i thougth
          i am not talented. but, in the end, <br />i know these day most
          important thing needed to learn programming is Perseverance, which is
          keep trying even it is hard :) Cheers!
