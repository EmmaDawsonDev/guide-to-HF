        <p> 
            First of all, thank you for maintaining <a href ='https://github.com/emmalearnscode/guide-to-HF'>this project</a> for being first time of hacktoberfest.
            I actually saw some great reviews of hacktoberfest 2019, so I'm trying to get familiar with Pull Requests.  
            I saw some tweets talking about how bad contributors spam around big projects with changing some minor alphabets or giving ridiculous words behind the original sentences.
            IMO that guys should tryout this kinda projects;(newbie friendly projects) rather than spamming n bothering others. 
            Anyway, this will my second PR and I really hope to end up having 4 PRs in October.

        <p> 
            How about making PRs with language translations? <br>
            I use some linux open source programs but it was not translated in my first language. So I made some pull requests with those.
