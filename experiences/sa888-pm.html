<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Hello, I am <b>Soon A</b> from Malaysia. I am very excited about Hacktoberfest 2020, as this is my first time contributing to open source. I am gaining insights of how open source works and how git and github works.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I had a basic understanding of github and open source world, but had never known from where to start. Every-time I decided to contribute, I just got overwhelmed of so much information. Hactoberfest really helped and pushed me in contributing to open source projects and become a part of such a lovely community. I learnt about how to fork a repository, clone a repository and create a pull request and eventually contributing to it. Its been an amazing and educative experience overall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">My tips and tricks would be that try to understand the process, learn how its done. Once you know the drill, you can apply your knowledge and contribute in any form. Knowing and being clear about your basics is really inportant according to me. Hope I was of some help. I am really enjoying this journey and hope to explore new aspects of open source everyday and continue being part of this amazing community.Thank you :)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
