            for this repo on GitHub and see if there's an issue that you want to
            resolve. Write a comment asking to be assigned. Once assigned fork
            the repo, clone it to your machine and make your edits. Then when
            you're done make your Pull Request back to this repo.

            If you want to practise your HTML and CSS skills then this is the
            perfect way to make a meaningful contribution to Hacktoberfest.
            Create a one-page html document about something you have learnt by
            taking part which may help other Newbies.
          </p>
          <div class="how-to">
            <h3>How to:</h3>

            <ol>
              <li><a href="#fork.html">Fork</a> and clone the repo</li>
              <li>
                Within the experiences folder create your own HTML and CSS
                files. Name your files Your-name.html and Your-name.css so they
                are easy for me to keep track of.
              </li>
              <li>
                The only prerequisite is that you add a link back to the
                homepage (index.html) file at the top of your page.
              </li>
              <li>Make your <a href="pull.html">Pull Request</a></li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p>
            Once that is done and your pull request accepted, we will then add a
            link to your page from the homepage so that everyone can read about
            your experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please be patient, this is the first time we've taken part and we
            don't know how much traffic to expect.
